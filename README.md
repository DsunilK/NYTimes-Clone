# NYTimes-Clone
Clone page of NewYork Times 

We made a clone of the NYTimes page, it has a functional video, buttons, and interactive icons. It has mock suggestions showing video name and views, and a mock section for commentaries. The focus of this branch was to make everything fit in the right places.
